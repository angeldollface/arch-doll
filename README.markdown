# ARCH DOLL :ribbon: :penguin:

***An installation script to install Arch Linux for my preferences. :ribbon: :penguin:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I've installedd Arch Linux about 2 million times on my machine already and I'm getting tired of doing this manually every single time, I thought I'd write a shell script to make my life easier. This repository contains that shell script.

## STATUS :warning:

This is still a bit work in progress!

## CONTRIBUTING :gear:

If you want to contribute, you can fork this repository and modify the flags at the top for your own purposes. I will not be accepting PRs. This install script is for my language, keyboard and uses my own resources.

## FEATURES :test_tube:

- Minimal and simple.
- Hyprland as the window manager.
- Waybar as the system panel.
- Based on Arch Linux.
- Open RC as the init system.
- Light DM as the Display Manager.
- My own boot animation.
- My own wallpaper.

## USAGE :hammer:

To use this script, assuming you are just booting the latest Arch Linux ISO, run these commands in the following order:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angeldollface/arch-doll/main/src/arch-doll.sh
chmod a+x arch-doll.sh
./arch-doll.sh
```

The computer should restart and you will be booting into a heavily customized Arch Linux installation.
